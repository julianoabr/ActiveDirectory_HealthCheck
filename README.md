# How to Use the Script

*_PUT ALL FILES IN SAME DIRECTORY_*

*_YOU SHOULD CREATE AN SERVICE ACCOUNT WITH DOMAIN ADMINS PERMISSIONS TO RUN THIS SCRIPT PROPERLY_"

[x] AD_Health_Check_v1.18_GIT.ps1 - This is the main script

[x] AD_Configuration.xml - file where you put your PDC, SCHEMA MASTER, RID MASTER, INTRASTRUCTURE MASTER, NAMING MASTER and yours Sites, Subnets and Links 

[x] gpotool.exe - This tool is explained in https://www.windowstechno.com/group-policy-verification-tool-gpotool-exe/

[x]ADHC_Auxiliar_XML.xlsx - worksheet to help to fill the XML after you run the script for the first time

[x] Button-Blank-Gray-icon.png ,Button-Blank-Green-icon.png, Button-Blank-Red-icon.png and Button-Blank-Yellow-icon.png  - Images must stay in subfolder Images. One level where you put the main script. 

[x]When you run this script for the first time, the HTML output will bring information about Sites, Subnets, Adjacent Sites and Site Links (with yellow collor). You have to insert all information in Ad_Configuration.xml for the next time these informations will become in green colour and any change will be noted. To help I created a worksheet called ADHC_Auxiliar_XML.xlsx where you put the information and paste to the XML.
